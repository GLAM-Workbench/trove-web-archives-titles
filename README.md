# GLAM Workbench Data Repository Template

This template repository is intended for repositories containing datasets generated by GLAM Workbench notebooks. GW data repositories will be associated with [GW code repos](https://github.com/michaelniemann/glam-workbench-template/) (eg: `trove-books-data` contains datasets created by `trove-books`), and each individual dataset should be linked to the notebook that created it.

Relationships between datasets, notebooks, and documentation are captured in an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, following the [RO-Crate standard](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/). This repository contains some useful scripts for updating and managing the RO-Crate metadata and associated Frictionless table schemas describing datasets.

Use the `update_crate.py` script in the corresponding *code repo* to generate the initial `ro-crate-metadata.json` file for this repository.

The RO-Crate file for a data repo differs from the version created for a code repo. In particular:

- ids for notebooks are converted to full urls pointing to the code repo
- ids for datasets are converted from full urls to file names
- only notebooks that generate data files are included

The `update_data_crate.py` script in this template repo updates file details and versions in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, and also generates and links a Frictionless Table Data schema file.

The basic steps to creating a new data repository are:

- use this template to create a new GitHub repository
- clone the data repo locally, `cd` into the directory
- create a new virtualenv – `pyenv virtualenv [new code repo]`
- activate – `pyenv local [new code repo]`
- `pip install pip-tools`
- `pip-sync requirements.txt`
- copy/commit the datasets to the new data repo
- make sure there are links in the notebook metadata to the generated datasets (use full GH urls)
- copy the url of the new code repository
- in the code repository, run the `update_crate.py` script with the `--data-repo` parameter set to the url of the new data repo
- copy the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file created in the `data-rocrate` directory to the new data repository
- in the data repository run `scripts/update_data_crate.py` script to generate and link Frictionless Table Data schemas for each dataset
- edit the schema file to add names and descriptions to the column values
- generate a new README file from the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file by running the `generate_readme.py` script (will overwrite this page)

To create a new version:

- use the `--version` option with `update_data_crate.py` to set a version number, eg: `v1.0`

To update existing datasets:

- copy the new versions into this repository and run `update_data_crate.py` to update dates and stats
- the script checks the updated datasets against the existing schemas, if columns have been added or removed, this validation will fail, in this case delete the schema file and run again

To add new datasets:

 - follow the steps under create a new data repo to generate a new `ro-crate-metadata.json` file
